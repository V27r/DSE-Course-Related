    <h1>About W3C</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Established in 1994 and led by Tim Berners-Lee, W3C is composed of member organizations with full-time staff dedicated to the development of web standards.</p>
    <p>As of March 5, 2023, W3C had 462 members. Beyond standardization, W3C actively engages in education and outreach, develops essential software, and serves as an open platform for discussions about the Web.</p>

    <h2 id="section1">History of W3C</h2>
    <p>W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, shortly after his departure from CERN. It was established at MIT with support from various organizations, including DARPA, a precursor to the Internet. Initially situated in Technology Square, it relocated to the Stata Center in 2004.</p>
    <p>W3C's primary goal is to promote compatibility and consensus among industry members in the adoption of new web standards. The consortium strives to ensure uniformity in web page rendering by encouraging vendors to implement a set of core principles and components.</p>
    <p>Originally, CERN was intended to host the European branch of W3C, but it shifted its focus to particle physics. Consequently, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation took over as the European host in 1995, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC assuming the role of the Asian host in 1996. W3C has established regional offices worldwide, spanning multiple countries.</p>
    <p>In 2012, W3C launched a MediaWiki wiki named WebPlatform and WebPlatform Docs, dedicated to documenting open web standards. In 2013, Beihang University became the Chinese host of W3C.</p>
    <p>In 2022, W3C's WebFonts Working Group received an Emmy Award for its standardizing font technology for web and TV devices.</p>
    <p>On January 1, 2023, W3C underwent reformation and transformed into a public-interest 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.</p>
    <h2 id="section2">W3C's Standards</h2>
    <p>W3C's standards are the backbone of the World Wide Web, ensuring consistency and compatibility across web technologies. These standards encompass essential technologies like HTML and CSS, which define web content structure and styling, respectively. W3C continues to evolve these standards, such as HTML5 and CSS3, to introduce new features and capabilities, empowering developers to create dynamic web experiences.</p>
    <h2 id="section3">Working Groups</h2>
    <p>W3C organizes working groups to develop and maintain web standards. These groups are instrumental in advancing web technologies, addressing challenges, and ensuring that web standards meet the evolving needs of the digital landscape. Collaboration within these groups is essential to drive innovation and maintain the relevance of web standards.</p>
    <h2 id="section4">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
    <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the web's inventor and one of the key figures behind W3C, has significantly influenced the development of the World Wide Web.
