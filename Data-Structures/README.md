# Data-Structures
This GitHub repository contains a collection of C++ programs aligned with specific Course Outcomes (COs) related to computer science. Here's a summary of the programs and their alignment with COs:

**CO1 (Course Outcome 1):**
- Includes programs from Week 1 and Week 2 folders.
- A class employee is defined to manage employee data, including salary calculations.
- A class flight is created to manage flight information, including fuel calculations based on distance.

**CO2 (Course Outcome 2):**
- Includes programs from the Week 11 folder.
- Programs for mapping 2-D arrays to 1-D arrays for different matrix types.
- Representation of sparse matrices using 1-D arrays.

**CO3 (Course Outcome 3):**
- Includes programs from the Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 7, and Week 10 folders.
- Polynomial representation using 1-D arrays and performing addition/subtraction.
- String operations without using string handling functions.
- Recursive programs for factorial, GCD, Fibonacci, and solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.

**CO4 (Course Outcome 4):**
- Includes programs from the Week 6, Week 8, and Week 9 folders.
- Implementation of stacks and queues using arrays.
- Checking parenthesized expressions for proper matching.
- Programs for checking palindrome strings and copying strings using recursion.
- Linked list operations: insertion, deletion, sorting, and more.
- Doubly linked list operations, including insertion, deletion, and polynomial addition.
- Binary tree operations like traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), counting leaf nodes, parent printing, depth calculation, and ancestor printing.
- Binary search tree operations including construction, search, insertion, and deletion.
- Sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
- Graph representation using adjacency lists and matrices.
- Sorting algorithms like heapsort and mergesort.
- Additional questions on BFS and DFS in graphs and constructing expression trees from expressions.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and practicing various C++ programs, with each folder aligned with specific Course Outcomes in the field of computer science.
